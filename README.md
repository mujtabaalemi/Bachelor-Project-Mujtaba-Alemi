# Introduction
This repository contains the data collected for the study of the manipulative design (dark patterns) regarding cookie consent notices. The research is separated into two parts. The first part consists of data collection and analysing concerning the use of a laptop. The second part consists of comparing results of cookie consent notices collected through mobile devices against the results of the first part. This research will focus mainly on consent notices regarding Dutch news platforms. Therefore, consent pop-ups from Â± 30 Dutch news outlets will be manually collected and analysed. The outline of the repository is as follows.
